PebbleSDK2
==========

Improve waf-based Pebble SDK build system regarding dependencies handling.

HOW TO CREATE THE WAF SCRIPT FOR PEBBLE SDK
-------------------------------------------
Simply execute:
./waf-light configure build
And replace the generated waf script into your PebbleSDK/Pebble directory

MODIFICATIONS
-------------

- waflib.Task.Task have been overloaded to make signature of Tasks in charge of handling resources (.raw, .png, .png-trans, .font) depends on a hash of the dictionnary generated by parsing appinfo.json.

- Build have been refactored into 5 Task Generators: appinfo_res, datapack, appinfo_auto_c, pbl_program, pbl_bundle. Also general purpose Task Generator are used instead of Rule-based ones except for pbl_bundle for which almost no modification have been made.

- Dependencies of Nodes generated into each of the 5 Task Generators are properly handled so that re-build are triggered only when necessary.
